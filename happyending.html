        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Szekeres" title="Esther Szekeres">Esther Klein</a>
            a mathematician, introduced the mathematical problem that would become called the Happy ending Problem.
            <b>She observed that for any given set of five points in general position, one can find a subset of four
            points that form a convex quadrilateral.</b> Two of her peers at the time 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s" title="Paul Erdos">Paul Erdos</a> and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Szekeres" title="George Szekeres">George Szekeres</a>
            ended up working on Klein's problem in a general form. 
            This eventualy led to the mariage of Esther Klein and George Szekeres and was there for called 
            the happy ending problem by Paul Erdos.

        <h2>k-gon or subset of k points</h2>
        <p>The convex quadrilateral mentioned in the introduction can be caled a 4-gon or a k-gon where k equals 4.
            Finding k-gon's became one of the main questions of Szekeres and Erdos work mentioned above.
            <b>Is there a function of k that gives us the minimum size a point set N needs to be to guaranty the k-gon exists?</b>
        Untill today this question is still unsolved and unproven.

        <h2>Erdos-Szekeres Conjecture</h2>
        <p>
          Proofs exist for the problem when using the specific values 3, 4, 5 and recently proved 6 for k. But the general form has not been proved,
          thus it is formulated as a conjecture, and known as the Erdos and Szekeres conjecture .
           Where for a k bigger then three the set of points N needs to be at least of size

        <h2>Upperbound when calculating k-gons</h2>
        <p>
          The conjecture mentioned above uses the fact that a upperbound exists for the calculation of a subset of k points or k-gon.
          This was proven in 1935 in the original paper <cite>A combinatorial problem in geometry</cite> by Erdos and Szekeres. 
          The proof is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey%27s_theorem" title="Ramsey's theorem">Ramsey's theorem</a>
          for 2-colored hypergraphs. Since it was proven that such a upperbound exists multiple attemps to improve that upperbound happend over time.
