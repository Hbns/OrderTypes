            <h1 class="bold_title">Welcome to this website about Order Types of point sets</h1>
            <p>Here, you will find several resources to help you learn about Order Types.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                You can follow a step-by-step tutorial, giving you an intuition for what they are and what they can
                be used for. If, during the reading, some word or concept is unclear, you can always search through
                the glossary. <br><br> For a more hands-on and visual approach the interactive demo will allow you to
                play around and compare the properties of point sets and their order type. The demo also allows for
                the search of the exhaustive database of Order Types compiled by [Aichholtzer et al. (2001)].
                Finally, the last page goes through the implementation details of some key algorithms making the
                demo possible.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
                The goals of this project were to create a website for the familiarisation with the concept of Order
                Types of point sets and the exploration of the exhaustive database of Order Types and their
                properties. With this in mind, a theoretical introduction to the topic is provided in form of a
                tutorial and a glossary, as well as a more hands-on approach consisting of a demo application the users
                can play with. </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Shortcomings and possible improvements</h2>
            <p>
                The major shortcoming of the demo is an error in the search of an equivalent point set to the set drawn
                by the user, which in certain cases fails.
            </p>
            <p>
                The web version of the demo only handles a maximum of 9 points due to large file sizes for 10 points and
                above, files which need to be transferred to the client in order to be processed.
