        <h1>Welcome to this website explaining Order Types of point sets</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Here you will find ressources to understand what order types are and how we can munipulate them. Besides a
          tutorial, the website also provides a glossary of terms directly related to order types or that are more
          general in Computational Geometry as well as an interactive demo.</p>
        <p>The data used to compare user inputs with or to look up a property comes from the exhaustive database of
          Order Types of upto 11 points along with some properties about them provided by O. Aichholzer, F. Aurenhammer,
          and H. Krasser. The database can be found <a
            href="http://www.ist.tugraz.at/staff/aichholzer/research/rp/triangulations/ordertypes/">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Please visit the different pages of the website to explore what it has to offer.</p>

        <h2>Tutorial - What is an order type</h2>
        <p>In this section we want to explain in an intuitive way what order types are and how we can manipulate them as
          well as some of their applications.</p>
        <p>I will start by giving you the full definition and then we'll brake it down and understand it piece by piece.
        </p>
        <blockquote>The order type of a set {p1, p2, ..., pn} of points in general position is a mapping that assigns to
          each ordered triple i, j, k in {1, ..., n} the orientation (clockwise or counter-clockwise) of the point
          triple pi, pj, pk.</blockquote>
        <p>Ok, as expected, this is still a bit obscure, but it will all make sense soon!</p>
        <p>Let's start with the easy part: the point set. This really is what it sounds like; a collection of points.
          Consider, for example, the following point set S of 6 points in the plane.</p>
        <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/jzmluyc6lb?embed" width="500px" height="500px"style="border: 1px solid #ccc;" frameborder=0></iframe>

        <br><br>
        <p>The following concept is that of general position. This is a property that can apply to points or to lines.
        <ul>
          <li>For points it means that no three points in the given set can be colinear (on the same line).</li>
          <li>Two lines that are not parallel will inevitable intersect. General position for lines simply means that no
            three lines can intersect in the same point.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>The following construction shows a set of points that is NOT in general position. Adding p7 to S broke the
          property as it is now possible to draw a line through p3, p7 and p2.</p>

        <br><br>
        <p>Now, let's skip ahead a bit and talk about the orientation of a triple of points.</p>
        <p>The orientation of an ordered triple of points expresses how the third point is positioned relative to the
          first two. Three points p1, p2, p3 can only be in three different orientations: clockwise, counter-clockwise
          or alligned. The following figure shows the three options.</p>
        <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/9g1octzxb1?embed" width="500px" height="500px"
          style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>
        <ul>
          <li>In red: p3 lies on the left of p1p2 and p1,p2,p3 form a left turn (counter-clockwise rotation)</li>
          <li>In purle: p3 is on p1p2 and p1, p2, p3 form a straight line (alligned)</li>
          <li>In blue: p3 lies on the right of p1p2 and p1, p2, p3 form a right turn (clockwise rotation)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The orientation of three points can be computed by the following matrix called Orientation Determinant. When
          the value of the determinant d is d&lt;0, d=0, d&gt;0 the three points form a counter-clockwise, no, clockwise
          rotation.</p>

        <br><br>
        <p>Good, now we're ready to tackle the main part of the definition. </p>
        <p>The somewhat compicated formulation boils down to this: For each triple of points in the set keep their
          orientation.</p>
        <p>A more intuitive definition is a question: "In what way are the points of this set arranged relative to each
          other?". For example, all sets of four points fall into two order types. One point set is drawn below for
          each.</p>

          style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>
        <p>Either the points are in the arangement "triangle containing a point" or "no triangle contains another
          point". There is no other option for size four.</p>

        <p>This information can be used to compare different sets of points. Two sets with the same orde type for
          example will have the same number of triangulations.</p>


        <h1>Tutorial - Order Type Encoding</h1>
        <p>Now that we understand what an order type is we need to know how to work with them. But, how do we compute the order type of a point set to learn about its properties and compare them to that of another set. We need a way to encode Order Types.</p>
        <p>As the number of Order Types increases exponentially with the size of the set of points, effiency is required.</p>
        <p>Multiple encodings exist:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A litteral approach would be to store for each triple of points their orientation. This is very space-inefficient.</li>
          <li>Instead of storing the orientation of triples, we could store the points themselves and recompute the triples when necessary. This compact but query times will suffer greatly</li>
          <li>Wiring diagram</li>
          <li>Lambda Matrix: This clever solution allows for a quadratic cost of storage and can be compared directly with other matrices.</li>
        </ul>
