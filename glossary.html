        <h1>Glossary</h1>
        <p>This page provides a list of words or concepts related to the topic of order types or Computational Geometry in general and explains them briefly.</p>
        <div>
          <h4>Point set</h3>
          <p>A collection of points (in the plane, RÂ²)</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>General position</h3>
          <p>A set of points is said to be in general position when no three of its points are colinear. Similarly, a set of lines is said to be in general position when no three of its lines itersect in the same point.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Orientation determinant</h3>
          <p>Given three points on the plane p1, p2, p3, the orientation determinant expresses where the third point lies with respect to the directed line through p1 and p2. If this determinant is positive, the point p3 lies to the left of p1p2. If it is negative, it lies to the right of p1p2. Finally, if it is equal to zero, p3 lies on p1p2. The value of the determinant is given by the following matrix. <br> ABSTRACT vs REALISABLE</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Order type</h3>
          <p>The order type of a set {p1, p2, ..., pn} of points in general position is a mapping that assigns to each ordered triple i, j, k in {1, ..., n} the orientation (clockwise or counter-clockwise) of the point triple pi, pj, pk.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Chrirotope</h3>
          <p>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Combinatorial explosion</h3>
          <p>In combinatorics, it is often required to count objects or properties of a system of elements. The expression Combinatorial explosion is used when the number we are trying to count increases fast with respect to the number of elements. Where fast means that it rapidly becomes impossible to enumerate the objects or properties due to their number.</p>

        <div>
          <h4>Order type encoding</h3>
          <p>An order type encoding is a way to encode or represent an order type. This can be done in various way, each with their advantages and disadvantages.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Point list: Simple store a list of points that represent the order type.</li>
            <li>Wiring diagram: Encodes the order type by keeping track of how the dual lines of the points intersect.</li>
            <li>Lambda Matrix: A n*n matrix M (where n is the number of points of the order type) that for each pair of different points of the type pi, pj stores in location M[i,j] the number of points to the left (or right) of the line through pi and pj.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Duality</h3>
          <p>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</p>
